#  Welcome! 

Hi there! I'm [Your Name], a budding web developer exploring the colorful world of front-end development. This is my very first interactive project - a playful gradient generator that creates beautiful color transitions!

## Browser Screenshot 📸

Here's a screenshot of the gradient generator in action:
